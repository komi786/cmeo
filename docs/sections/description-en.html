<span class="markdown">CMEO (Clinical Metadata Exploration Ontology) is an ontology for representing and querying study- and variable-level metadata from clinical cohort studies in a consistent, machine-interpretable way. CMEO models the semantics of data elements (variables) and their key metadata needed for cross-cohort discovery and harmonization—such as human-readable labels/definitions, domain/type information (e.g., condition, measurement, medication), permissible categorical values, units, visit/timepoint context, derivation/provenance (e.g., computed variables), and basic descriptive statistics. It is designed to support metadata-driven tasks including cohort cataloguing, feasibility assessment, study retrieval, and identification of compatible variables across studies—without requiring access to patient-level data.

CMEO is intended to interoperate with controlled vocabularies and common clinical terminologies by linking data elements and value sets to external concept identifiers (e.g., OMOP concept IDs, SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm/ATC, UCUM) while remaining model-agnostic (i.e., not tied to a single CDM).</span>
