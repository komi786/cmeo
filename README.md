Data Integration Ontology for clinical studies
The primary goal is to develop a unified ontological framework (hyper-ontology) that integrates multiple existing ontologies, supported by foundational ontologies tailored for healthcare contexts. This framework aims to standardize both clinical study metadata specification and patient-level observational data while providing a unified representation for statistical analyses across studies. Existing ontologies built for one or more similar objectives includes Ontology of Biomedical Investigation, statistics ontology and ontology for biomedical and clinical statistics, all are built upon Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) principles. Thet can be extended for coverage to detailed definitions of data elements and addressing gaps in patient-level data representation. Inspired by real-world clinical applications, CDIO emphasizes data harmonization between clinical studies by representing study design specification and data elements specified and observation values for each data element with exploratory data analysis in unified manner
